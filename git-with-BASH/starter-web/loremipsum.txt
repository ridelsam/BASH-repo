(Jon Ribbens) The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released.

(John Johnson) There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home. (Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977)
